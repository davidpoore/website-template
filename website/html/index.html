                      At GTRI, my current project is primarily front-end development in AngularJS. Working with the design team, I have taken
                      the mockups and wireframes for the application and translated them into interactive web pages using HTML5, CSS3, and AngularJS.
                      Previous projects I have worked on include adding advanced search functionality to our applications and acting as the lead developer
                      for a document management system.

                      Currently, I am working with Georgia Tech's EarSketch team to help create a music-based computer science curriculum. My principal involvement with this
                      project has been as a member of the social media team, designing and implementing a website that allows students to publish their work and share it with
                      others. Right now, we are working to implement an online IDE and DAW and I am doing the initial design work for the site layout.

                      I worked on implementing the initial prototype for this project during my senior year of my undergraduate studies at Georgia Tech. The system allows users
                      to log in using their Facebook profile at large events - in particular, Georgia Tech football games - and find out which of their Facebook friends were also at
                      the event. The project is currently in it's third iteration, but the underlying code is still based on my initial prototype.

                  <p>
                    Outside of software development, most of my hobbies are related to either
                    music or gaming. I have been a bassist, vocalist, and guitarist for several
                    small projects, and have contributed to multiple music technology projects
                    at Georgia Tech. I also enjoy going to shows, especially at smaller venues,
                    and I love discovering new music and artists.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In the gaming world, I am primarily interested in turned-based strategy
                    games, such as the Civilization series, and I am also an avid Magic: the
                    Gathering player. I occasionally play tabletop strategy games such as
                    Warmachine and Warhammer 40k.

                  <p>
                    Other hobbies I've dabbled in (and continue to dabble in over the years) include
                    homebrewing, game design, poetry & creative writing, and stand-up comedy.
