                        Working for the Cyber Technology lab at GTRI, my current project is primarily front-end development in AngularJS. Working with the design team, I have taken
                        the mockups and wireframes for our application and translated them into interactive web pages using HTML5, CSS3, and AngularJS.
                        Previous projects I have worked on include adding advanced search functionality to our applications and acting as the lead developer
                        for a document management system.

                        Currently, I am working with Georgia Tech's EarSketch team to help create a music-based computer science curriculum for high school students. My principal 
                        involvement with this project has been as a member of the social media team, designing and implementing a website that allows students to publish their work 
                        and share it with others. Right now, we are working to implement an online IDE and DAW and I am doing the initial design work for the site layout, and then
                        implementing the design using Twitter Bootstrap and AngularJS.

                        For EGG, I worked on implementing the initial prototype for the FriendFinder project. The system allows users to log in using their Facebook profile and 
                        discover which of their Facebook friends were at the same location as them - in this case, Georgia Tech football games. The project is currently in it's third 
                        iteration, but the underlying code is still based on my initial prototype.
